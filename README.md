# Emberkai Icons

File and folder icons for JetBrains IDEs, named to complement the Emberkai theme. Built on the Symbols icon set, with native IntelliJ icons for Java and Kotlin.

Java sources (`.java`), compiled classes (`.class`), Kotlin sources (`.kt`), and Kotlin scripts (`.kts`) keep the IDE's type icons and modifier badges. Other files and folders use Symbols icons.

## Install

1. Download the ZIP from [Releases](https://github.com/khopland/idea-symbols/releases/latest).
2. Disable the original Symbols Icons plugin if installed.
3. Open **Settings > Plugins > ⚙️ > Install Plugin from Disk...** and select the ZIP.
4. Restart if prompted.

## Build

Requires Java 21. No icon generator or submodules are needed.

```sh
./gradlew test verifyPluginStructure buildPlugin
```

The ZIP is written to `build/distributions/emberkai-icons-<version>.zip`. Run `./gradlew runIde` to try the plugin in a sandbox.

The plugin is one Java class. Icon mappings are in `src/main/resources/symbols/icons.properties`; SVGs are in `src/main/resources/symbols/icons/`. Edit these files directly to change icons.

## Update upstream icons

Run the Bash script to fetch the latest icons and associations from [vscode-symbols](https://github.com/miguelsolorio/vscode-symbols):

```sh
./scripts/update-icons.sh
```

Requires Bash 3.2+, Git, jq 1.6+, and standard Unix tools, available on GitHub Actions Ubuntu runners. The default source is upstream `main`; use `--ref` to select a tag or commit:

```sh
./scripts/update-icons.sh --ref 2c95b15b0a8ef95ac62855e3784a6024ee6e5d2e
./scripts/update-icons.sh --ref 2c95b15b0a8ef95ac62855e3784a6024ee6e5d2e --check
```

`--check` writes nothing and exits with status 1 when an update is needed (errors also return a nonzero status). The script works from any directory, requires no credentials, and runs without prompts. It validates the downloaded files before replacing the bundled SVGs and mappings, sizes icons to 16×16 while preserving their view boxes, copies the upstream license, and records the source commit in `NOTICE` and the mapping header. Java and Kotlin keep their native IDE icons. Updating replaces local edits to the generated files; review and commit the resulting diff, then run the build checks above.

For CI, run the same command before the Gradle build. The manual **Update icons** GitHub Actions workflow accepts an upstream ref, runs the updater and build checks, and uploads the refreshed sources and plugin ZIP as artifacts. Download the sources into the repository root to review and commit them.
